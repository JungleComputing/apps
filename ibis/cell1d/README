This directory contains a simple implementation of cellular automata (CA).
It uses the Ibis communication classes immediately.

It is currently hard-coded to implement Conway's game of Life (which is
a particular CA).

The program takes one optional parameter: the number of generations to
run this simulation. Default is 10.
