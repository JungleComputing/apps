Prerequisites
-------------

Assumption is: you are on fs0.das3, and in the root directory of this
project. You also need Satin, which you can check out from
https://gforge.cs.vu.nl/svn/ibis/satin/trunk, and build using 'ant'.
You also need to set the SATIN_HOME environment variable to the
root of the Satin tree.

Compiling
---------
Should now be a piece of cake: just call "ant".

Running using the cluster simulator
-----------------------------------
First, you need to run a PoolInfo server (not the one included with Ibis!).
Run the following command in the background:

java -cp 'lib/*' clusteremulation.PoolInfoServer -port 12349 &

Also, you need to run an Ibis/Satin server, but without a hub:

$SATIN_HOME/bin/satin-run -Xmx256M -Dsmartsockets.networks.name=ns ibis.server.Server --no-hub --events --port 12345 > server.out 2>&1 &

You can change the port numbers, but then you must also change the
port numbers in the scripts in the job sub-directory.

Now you are ready to run any of the jobs from the jobs sub-directory.
These scripts run the two Barnes versions on three different cluster
configurations: cluster/barnes01.env, cluster/barnes02.env,
and cluster/barnes01.env without traffic shaping.
