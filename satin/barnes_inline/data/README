D1 is a 2500-body dataset consisting of a Plummer and a single, high-mass
body. Should be run with a timestep not larger than 0.03125 and theta at
least 2, otherwise too many anomalities will occur. Run for thousands of
iterations.
D2 is a 4096-body dataset, similar in concept to D1.
D3 is a 4096-body dataset consisting of two Plummers colliding. Eventually
results in a merge of the two systems. Should be run with a timestep not
larger than 0.03125 and theta at least 2, otherwise too many anomalities
will occur. Run for about 1500 iterations.
D4 is a 4096-body dataset consisting of a disk and a Plummer colliding.
A bit disappointing.
