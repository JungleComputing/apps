This directory contains a simple text compressor that uses backreferences
to previous text as compression method. It looks ahead for a number of
compression steps to select the best sequence of backreferences.

usage:

Compress <input-file> <output-file>

There is also a de-compressor:

Decompress <input-file> <output-file>

Configuration.LOOKAHEAD_DEPTH determines the number of look-ahead moves.
Beware that some types of text (e.g. source code) may cause a much larger
number of possibilities.
