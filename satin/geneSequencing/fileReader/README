The File Reading Version

Database searching is one of the most fundamental tasks in bioinformatics. Within
this search two DNA sequences are compared with each other to identify similarities
and differences between them.

In this version we use the standard data approach for spawning of jobs.
However, the data distribution is different. There are two vectors with file
pointers which are created before spawning of jobs. A pointer points to a position of a
sequence in a file from a problem set. These pointers are distributed to the leaf nodes.
The input data of a job consists of parameters for the search algorithm and two vectors
with the file pointers. When the calculation starts, the sequence is read out from a file
with usage of a file pointer.

How to compile the prgram:

Just run 'ant' with the delivered build.xml file.

How to run the program (a sample of a run command):

prun -v /home/eapikoul/ibis/bin/ibis-prun 10 DsearchDCf
