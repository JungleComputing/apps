The Shared Object version

Database searching is one of the most fundamental tasks in bioinformatics. Within
this search two DNA sequences are compared with each other to identify similarities
and differences between them.

In this version we use the divide-and-share model: the divide-and-conquer model
extended by a shared data abstraction â€“ shared objects.
In this version the query sequences file and the database sequences file are read out on
the root node and processed into two vectors. Vector pointers are created as well.
They point to an index of a sequence in the vector. The vectors are placed into a
shared object. The shared object is broadcasted to every node involved in the
computation. The input data of a job consists of parameters for the search algorithm
and two vectors with vector pointers. When the calculation starts, the sequence is read
out from shared object using a vector pointer.

How to compile the program:

Just run 'ant' with the delivered build.xml file.

How to run the program (a sample of a run command):

prun -v /home/eapikoul/ibis/bin/ibis-prun 10 -Dsatin.so DsearchDC_so
