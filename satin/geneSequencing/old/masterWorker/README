The Master-Worker version

Database searching is one of the most fundamental tasks in bioinformatics. Within
this search two DNA sequences are compared with each other to identify similarities
and differences between them.

In the application the master-worker version has been implemented as follows.
On the root node, the root process reads out the input files and parameters for the
computation. Then the main problem is divided into small identical sub-problems.
After that the master process collects all sub-results generated by workers and
processes them to the final result.

How to compile the program:

Just run 'ant' with the delivered build.xml file.

How to run the program (a sample of a run command):

prun -v /home/eapikoul/ibis/bin/ibis-prun 10 DsearchMW
