The Data Distribution version

Database searching is one of the most fundamental tasks in bioinformatics. Within
this search two DNA sequences are compared with each other to identify similarities
and differences between them.

In this version we use the standard data approach for spawning of jobs. The data
distribution is done in a native way. The data is read out on the root node and
processed into two vectors. After that it is distributed to leaf nodes. The input data for
a job consists of parameters for a search algorithm and two vectors with query
sequences and database sequences.

The input parameters for the program are in the input.txt file.

How to compile the program:

Just run 'ant' with the delivered build.xml file.

How to run the program (a sample of a run command):

prun -v /home/eapikoul/ibis/bin/ibis-prun 10 DsearchDC
